<h1>Red Thred Of Fate</h1>
<p> 
    The Red Thread of Fate (simplified Chinese: 姻缘红线; traditional Chinese: 姻緣紅線; pinyin: Yīnyuán hóngxiàn), 
    also referred to as the Red Thread of Marriage, and other variants, is an East Asian belief originating from 
    Chinese legend. According to this myth, the gods tie an invisible red cord around the Finger of those that are 
    destined to meet one another in a certain situation as they are "their true love".Often, in Japanese and Korean 
    culture, it is thought to be tied around the little finger. According to Chinese legend, the deity in charge of 
    "the red thread" is believed to be Yuè Xià Lǎorén (月下老人), often abbreviated to Yuè Lǎo (月老), the old lunar 
    matchmaker god, who is in charge of marriages.

    The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. 
    This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. This myth is similar to the Western concept of soulmate or a destined partner.

<h1>Folklore</h1>
<p>
    One story featuring the red thread of fate involves a young boy. Walking home one night, a young boy sees an old man 
    (Yue Xia Lao) standing beneath the moonlight. The man explains to the boy that he is attached to his destined wife 
    by a red thread. Yue Xia Lao shows the boy the young girl who is destined to be his wife. Being young and having 
    no interest in having a wife, the young boy picks up a rock and throws it at the girl, running away. Many years 
    later, when the boy has grown into a young man, his parents arrange a wedding for him. On the night of his wedding, 
    his wife waits for him in their bedroom, with the traditional veil covering her face. Raising it, the man is delighted 
    to find that his wife is one of the great beauties of his village. However, she wears an adornment on her eyebrow. 
    He asks her why she wears it and she responds that when she was a young girl, a boy threw a rock at her that struck 
    her, leaving a scar on her eyebrow. She self-consciously wears the adornment to cover it up. The woman is, in fact, the
    same young girl connected to the man by the red thread shown to him by Yue Xia Lao back in his childhood, showing that
    they were connected by the red thread of fate.

    Another version of the same story involves an ambitious young man who talks to Yue Xia Lao and insists on asking him 
    about who will he marry, thinking that he'll net himself a rich girl. Yue Xia Lao points at a poor-looking little girl 
    who's taking a stroll with an old blind woman in a marketplace, shows him a red thread between the two, and tells the 
    man that he'll marry her someday. Displeased, the man tells a servant to kill the two and then leaves the village. Years 
    later the man, now a promising public officer, marries a beautiful woman from a rich family who is very much the perfect 
    wife for him save for two details: she has a limp and covers her forehead with a silk patch for undisclosed reasons. 
    He asks his wife why and she begins crying, telling him that she is the niece of the family leaders rather than their 
    daughter: her parents died when she was young and she initially lived with her old blind nanny, but one day a madman 
    stabbed her caretaker to death in a local marketplace and wounded her, leaving her scarred and almost crippled. The man 
    realizes that Yue Xia Lao was right, tearfully confesses that he ordered the attack and asks his wife for forgiveness, 
    which she gives to him.
    
    
    In another story, a girl has a crush on a boy and decides to declare her love for him. Unfortunately, the boy rejects her 
    and makes fun of her. The girl run off to a fountain where she meets Yue Xao Lao who tells her they are soul mates. The 
    girl is still fuming and runs off. When the girl becomes a Lady she meets a young man who seems very charming and in other 
    terms familiar to her. She then asks the man for his name and he says the name I the young boy. The lady doesn't seem to 
    realise though and then on their special day he tells her a girl liked him but he was foolish and made fun of her for it, 
    he the exclaimed the girl had the same name as her. Realising who he was, she admits she was the girl and he eventually apologises.
